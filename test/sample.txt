The Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP) of the University of Tokyo was established on April 1
in 1957 as a joint research laboratory based upon the recommendation of the Science Council of Japan
and the concurrence between the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and the Science and
Technology Agency in order to carry on basic research in condensed matter physics. Within the first
15 to 20 years, ISSP had achieved its original mission, that is to serve as the central laboratory of
materials science in Japan equipped with state-of-art facilities that were open for all domestic
researches in order to bring the research in Japan up to par with the international level.
